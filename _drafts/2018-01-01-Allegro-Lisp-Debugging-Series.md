I'm in a transitional period of my life right now. Soon I'll be switching jobs and I'll go from using Allegro Common Lisp to a combination of Steel Bank and Lisp Works. Before I switch over I wanted to put together a couple guides on debugging in Allegro Common Lisp, a set of opinionated primers if you will. They should help provide an introduction to tools that have made my a more effective code debugging (and as a result a faster programmer). My hope is that other developers jumping into ACL will be able to take advantage of this as a resource going forward. 

1. Why learn debugging tools?
2. trace
3. trace practical
4. fwrappers
5. toplevel commands + Xref database
